# Abstract

Previous studies have found that environmental temperature decreases marathon performance. Additionally, older adults experience difficulties with thermoregulation. Using data provided by Dr. Brett Romano and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, I performed an exploratory data analysis aiming to examine the effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women; explore the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender; and identify the weather parameters that have the largest impact on marathon performance.wehypothesized that the weather would have a stronger negative impact on older runners, and that effects would be similar between men and women. Furthermore,we suspected that relative humidity, tempearture, and solar radiation would have the strongest impact on runners. Based on the results of my exploratory data analysis, weather has a stronger impact on runners as age increases, but effects do not vary significantly by gender. Furthermore, based on a linear regression and correlations between race results and weather conditions,wefound that relative humidity, air quality, and solar radiation have the largest impact on marathon performance. Future research is needed to statistically analyze the impact of weather, age, and gender on marathon performance. 

# Introduction

In recent years, we've seen an increase in marathon participants (Reusser et al., 2021), but also an increase in heatwaves (NOAA, 2024), which could impact athletic performance (Ely et al., 2007). Also, thermoregulation ability is known to decrease with age, affecting sweat gland function, skin blood flow, cardiac output, and blood flow redistribution (Kenny and Munce, 2023). This could potentially cause problems for older runners who are racing in unfavorable weather conditions. This has been shown in the New York marathon, where older runners were more affected by high temperatures and humidity (Knechtle et al. 2021). Differences in marathon performance are also seen across genders. For example, men are more likely to slow down over the course of the marathon (Deanor et al. 2015).

Using data provided by Dr. Brett Romano and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College,weperformed an exploratory data analysis with the following three aims: **1. Examine effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women. 2. Explore the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender. 3. Identify the weather parameters that have the largest impact on marathon performance. **wehypothesized that aging would decrease marathon performance, and that weather would have a stronger negative effect on marathon performance as age increased, but effects would be similar between men and women. Additionally,wehypothesized that humidity, solar radiation, and temperature would all have a strong impact on marathon performance, and that wind and air quality would have a lesser impact.

# Methods

## Data Description

```{r}
#load in the data that we use throughout the report
data <- read_csv("Downloads/project1.csv")
course_record <- read_csv("Downloads/course_record (2).csv")
aqi_values <- read_csv("Downloads/aqi_values.csv")
```

The provided data from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College contained results from the Boston, Chicago, New York, Twin Cities, and Grandma's marathons across 15-20 years. Each row of the data contained the top single-age performances from males and females between the ages of 14 and 85 for each of the 5 marathons. The following weather parameters were also included: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature (which factors in humidity), percent relative humidity, black globe temperature (factors in solar radiation), wind speed in km/hr, dew point, and WBGT (calculated as (.07 * Wet-bulb temperature) + (.02 * black globe temperature) + (0.1 * dry bulb temperature)). Additionally, a variable describing the flag color used to warn participants of weather conditions was used. The flag color was determined based on the following conditions: White = WGBT < 10C, Green = WGBT between 10-18C, Yellow = WGBT between 18-23C, Red = WBGT between 23-28C, and Black = WBGT > 28C.

Instead of the finishing time for each participant, the data provided the percent off the current course record for each gender. This value was used for most analyses to allow for more accurate comparisons across races, which may have varying difficulty. 

Additionally, we included air quality index measurements from the RAQSAPI package, which retrieves air quality data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. From this package, we selected to use air quality index (aqi) measurements from cbsa codes 14460, 35620, 33460, 16980, and 20260, from the dates of each of the marathons over the time period from 1993-2016.wechose to use the values from the 24 hour sample duration, which is recorded in micrograms/cubic meter. The data contained some duplicates, soweremoved duplicate values. Since each cbsa_code contained multiple sites,weaveraged the aqi data between all sites for each cbsa code for each date. 

#### Missing data and data preprocessing 
\
\
My first step in preprocessing the data was to rename the columns so that they were easier to handle within the code.weremoved spaces and symbols from variable names. Next,wechecked the data types of each variable to make sure they made sense for my analyses.wechanged "Race", "Year", "Sex", and "Flag" from character/numeric to factors.wealso changed the values for Race, so that each observation was the name of the marathon rather than a numerical code. We did the same for Sex, and re-coded 0 as "Female" and 1 as "Male". 

I also calculated the actual time of each participant in minutes, using the course records for each race for each year by gender. We converted the course record from hours into minutes, and then performed the following calculation: Time in minutes = ((Percent off course record)/100) + 1) * Course Record in minutes).

Based on data found from the analyses shown in Figure 1., we also created a variable that groups participants by age. Runners younger than 20 were in "Young", ages 20-49 were in "Middle", 50-64 were in "Older", and runners 65 or older were in "Senior". These groups were made based on trends in performance as age increased.


```{r, include = FALSE}
#data preprocessing

colnames(data) <- c("Race", "Year", "Sex", "Flag", "Age", "CR", "TdC", "TwC",

                                    Race == "NYC" ~ "New York",

                                  ))

#merge the data
data_w_aqi <- left_join(data, aqi_dat)

#remove this empty entry

#create bins for age groups
data_w_aqi <- data_w_aqi %>% mutate(Age_binned = case_when(Age < 20 ~ "Young",
                                       Age < 50 ~ "Middle",
                                       Age < 65 ~ "Older",
                                       Age < 99 ~ "Senior"))

#order the flags and age binds correctly
data_w_aqi$Flag <- factor(data_w_aqi$Flag, levels = 
                            c("White", "Green", "Yellow", "Red", "Black"))
data_w_aqi$Age_binned <- factor(data_w_aqi$Age_binned, levels = 
                                  c("Young", "Middle", "Older", "Senior"))

#make Cr.x just CR

colnames(data_w_aqi)[6] <- "CR"
```

Next,wechecked for missing data and found that weather variables, not including aqi, were missing for the Twin Cities, Chicago, and New York marathons in 2011, and the Grandma's marathon in 2012. AQI data was missing for 32 of the races. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
#examine missingness in the main data
sum(is.na(data_w_aqi))

#see which columns are missing data and how much
colSums(is.na(data_w_aqi))

#shows percent of data missing for each race and year to see if missingness 
#is race-specific
summary_of_missing <- data_w_aqi %>% 
  group_by(Race, Year) %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.x))*100/n(), .names = "{.col}"))

summary_of_missing
#the data for the weather columns other than aqi is missing for race 1 in 2011, 
#race 2 in 2011, race 3 in 2011, and race 4 in 2012
```

I checked the distribution of each variable, andwenoticed that 32% of the values for relative humidity were less than 1, but then the other 68% of the values were all greater than 33. This seemed suspicious, and after comparing the relative humidities that were less than 1 with several historical weather reports from those dates,wedecided that the data was just recorded in a different format, and that any values less than 1 could be multiplied by 100 to get the percent relative humidity. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
####get a histogram of the distribution of the values of each column
for (i in 1:ncol(data_w_aqi)){
  if (is.numeric(data_w_aqi[[i]])){
    hist(data_w_aqi[[i]], main = colnames(data_w_aqi)[i]) 
  }
  else{}
}

sum(na.omit(data$rh < 1))/nrow(na.omit(data))

min(na.omit(data[data$rh > 1,"rh"]))

#get humidity for each race
humidities <- data %>% group_by(Year, Race) %>% summarise(mean_humidity = mean(rh))

#if humidity was recorded as a decimal, change to a percent
data$rh <- ifelse(data$rh <= 1, data$rh*100, data$rh)

```

# Results

The data included 11,564 runners, of which 47% were female and 53% were male. Most races had a green flag (42%), while few had a red flag (5.3%). None of the data included the most severe flag option, black. The age groups were binned so that around 5% of participants were in "Young", 50% of participants were in "Middle", 25% in "Older", and 20% in "Senior". These statistics and other characteristics can be seen in Table 1. For continuous variables, medians and the first and third quartile were calculated. For categorical variables, counts and percentages are shown.

```{r}
#remove variables that I don't want in table

\newpage
To start, we plotted percent off of course record by age for each of the five marathons. As shown in Figure 1, the youngest runners gradually improved in performance until a peak around age 25. This was consistent for both males and females. Males and females both decreased in performance steadily until their late 50s-early 60s, and then performance began decreasing quickly. Running performance in females generally declined more with age, compared to males. However, performance became similar after about age 75. This suggests a possible interaction between age and gender on marathon performance, with women beginning to quickly decrease in pace at an earlier age than men. These results were consistent across races.

    legend.title = element_text(size = 14)
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 90, 10))

```
\
Next, we examined what ages were actually winning the marathons. We found the best performance for each race and year for each sex, and found that the most female winners were 28, and most male winners were 29 (Figure 2). The mean age of the female winners was 30.3125, and the mean age of male winners was 28.9898. 
\newpage
```{r}

#winners %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarize(mean_age = mean(Age))
```

```{r Fig 2, fig.cap = "Histogram of Ages of Marathon Winners by Gender", fig.show="hold", out.width="80%", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

```
\
\
I also visualized how average marathon times improved over time over the years, faceted by gender. As we can see from Figure 3, on average, both men and women have been improving over time since 1993. Women saw a quick increase in pace in the 1990s, and then plateaued from 2000-2008, but gradually improved from 2008-2016. Men have been steadily getting faster, aside from a plateau between 2000 and 2007.

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```
\
\newpage
To determine if a red flag results in a weaker average performance in each age group, we plotted the mean percent off course record for each of the binned age groups (Young, Middle, Older, and Senior; previously described in *Methods*), for each flag for each race (Figure 4). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals based on standard error. The only races that showed differences in performance based on flag were the Boston, Chicago, and Twin Cities marathons. In the Boston Marathon, the mean percent off course record increases between the white and red flags for all age groups except for "Young", and this increase appears to be largest in the "Senior" group. For the Twin Cities marathon, mean percent off course record also increases for all age groups except "Young" between the white flag and red flag. For the Chicago marathon, mean percent off course record increases between the white and red flags for the "Middle" and "Older" groups only. However, there were few (16) results recorded in the "Senior" age group with a red flag, so the lack of significance may be due to the small sample size. 
\
\
The difference in performance by age group may not necessarily be due to physiological effects caused by the weather. For example, runners could be aware that the flag was red and purposefully slowed down for their own well being and comfort, rather than being physically unable to go any faster. Older runners may believe that they are more susceptible to health problems from running in the heat than younger runners, so they choose to just run the race at a slower than usual pace.

To see how the weather variables are correlated with each other, we produced a plot of the correlations between the variables. Percent off of course record appears to only be strongly correlated with age. The weather variables are correlated with each other, which is to be expected since many of the variables are calculated based on other variables. Humidity and solar radiation are negatively correlated, and wind and aqi are negatively correlated.

We thought that stratifying the results by sex and age group might result in higher correlations of percent off of course record with the weather variables. In this correlation plot, we can see that the weather variables are not strongly correlated with percent off of course record for any of the groups. The performance of senior men is not correlated with any weather variables, but it is highly correlated with age (correlation = .80). Potentially, the effect of age is strong enough that it obscures the impact of any of the weather variables on percent off of course record. Senior womens' performance is also not correlated with any weather variables, other than a weak (.12) correlation with AQI. Older men and womens' performances are weakly correlated with dry bulb, wet bulb, black globe, dew point, WBGT, and AQI. Correlation does not seem to vary across gender within this age group. The runners in the middle age group's performances are also weakly correlated with the previously mentioned weather variables, except for AQI, although to a lesser extent than the "older" age group. These correlations also do not seem to vary across genders. We did not include the "Young" age group, since they had few observations and we suspected that they would not differ strongly from the "Middle" age group. Overall, WBGT seems to be the most correlated with a decreased performance across the age groups.

Finally, to further investigate the effects of age, sex, and WBGT on marathon performance, we performed a linear regression. We modeled percent off of course record based on the three way interaction of age, sex, and WBGT. The results of this regression are shown in Table 2. The interaction of age and WBGT is significant (p < .05), but the three way interaction is not, and neither is sex with WBGT. This agrees with the results from our previous correlation plots.

We also performed a second linear regression, this time using all the weather variables, age, year, race, and interactions between age with dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and air quality index. We found that age, year, race, relative humidity, solar radiation, air quality, the interaction of age with relative humidity, age with solar radiation, and age with air quality were significant. 

```{r}
summary <- summary(lm(CR ~ Age*Sex*WBGT, data=data_w_aqi))
kable(summary[["coefficients"]], caption = "Results of Linear Regression 
      of % Off of Course Record ~ Interaction between Age:Sex:WBGT", digits = 3)
```

summary2 <- summary(lm(CR ~ Age + Year + Race + Sex + TdC + TwC + rh + TgC +
                         SRWm2 + DP + aqi + Age*TdC + Age*TdC + Age*rh + 
                         Age*SRWm2 + Age*aqi, data=data_w_aqi))
kable(summary2[["coefficients"]])

# Discussion and Conclusion

This analysis shows that aging clearly impacts marathon performance, as shown in previous studies, and that this effect differs across gender. We initially hypothesized that aging would impact performance, but not necessarily across gender.

Furthermore, we show that the effects of weather conditions on marathon performance differ by age, when age is binned and when age is continuous. The results from Figure 4 demonstrate how the impact of the warning flag differs across age groups, with runners older than 65 being the most likely to experience a decline in performance in "red" conditions. Some weather conditions were shown to be important in predicting performance declines. These variables were relative humidity, solar radiation, and air quality. Since WGBT factors into these conditions, WGBT seems to be a good overall measure of weather conditions. However, since air quality is shown to be associated with marathon performance, it might be worthwhile to investigate how it could be factored into this the WGBT measurement, or how it should be included in further statistical analyses.

A limitation of this study is that the effects of the weather on marathon performance may not be entirely physiological, and that runners are aware of the weather conditions due to reading weather reports or seeing the flag conditions. Therefore, they might not be running at their fullest effort in order to protect their health and comfort. However, since this data contains only the top performers of each age, it is unlikely that the runners would be purposefully slowing themselves down. Another limitation is that the air quality index data is not as specific as it could be. Further research could map which exact air quality testing sites are nearest to the race course, rather than just using the closest cbsa code as we did in this study. Also, since this study is only looking at the top performers in each age group, it isn't necessarily applicable to slower or less experienced runners. Future research could focus on middle of the pack runners in each age group. Finally, since this is just an exploratory data analysis, more rigorous statistical analysis should be done to make any strong conclusions on the effects of weather on marathon runners.

In conclusion, aging is associated with decreased marathon performance in runners, and this effect varies across gender. Furthermore, weather conditions, specifically relative humidity, solar radiation, and aqi, affect marathon performance, and age interacts with all of these variables. The effects of weather on performance do not seem to differ by gender.
