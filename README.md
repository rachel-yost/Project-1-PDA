# Exploratory Analysis on the Effects of Weather Conditions and Aging on Marthon Performance


### Abstract

Previous studies have found that environmental temperature decreases marathon performance. Additionally, older adults experience difficulties with thermoregulation. Using data provided by Dr. Brett Romano and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, I performed an exploratory data analysis aiming to examine the effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women; explore the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender; and identify the weather parameters that have the largest impact on marathon performance.wehypothesized that the weather would have a stronger negative impact on older runners, and that effects would be similar between men and women. Furthermore,we suspected that relative humidity, tempearture, and solar radiation would have the strongest impact on runners. Based on the results of my exploratory data analysis, weather has a stronger impact on runners as age increases, but effects do not vary significantly by gender. Furthermore, based on a linear regression and correlations between race results and weather conditions,wefound that relative humidity, air quality, and solar radiation have the largest impact on marathon performance. Future research is needed to statistically analyze the impact of weather, age, and gender on marathon performance.
